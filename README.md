# BusinessStrategySimulator2

This repository contains the code for the second version of the business strategy simulator, created in Dr. Archibald's research lab in the Fall of 2023.

The goal of the simulator is to provide an environment wherein reinforcement learning agents can learn novel market entry and exit decisions in a model economy.

All the code dealing with the logic of the simulator and the incorporation of AI agents is contained in the WorkingFiles directory.
Files outside this directory include external dependencies and makefiles. Do not edit these.
